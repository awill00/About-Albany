# About-Albany
website about Albany
===================================
Final Project overall Comments
=================================
Very nice photo banners on each page. 
Navigation Bar should be the same throughout the website. Maybe all pages
use the one on that is on the Gardens page?  NavBar code should be copied
into all .html files so they look the same. Also have one nav.css file.
Gardens page is the only page that is flexing properly.
Put all images in images folder

==========================
About Albany Page
==========================
very nice layout. 
Nav bar - does not change color when hovered over.
 

=========================================
Architecture Page
========================================
looks good. Nice layout. 
Nav Bar - About Albany should be first, because that's the Home Page
Nav Bar should be consistent throughout the website. This one doesn't match horizontal style 
of others. 
"Garden" on this page and "Gardens" on other pages. 
Add some space below the description of the Empire State Plaza. Maybe 
make the link to the video more prominent - a button or image to click on
and say it's a short video. 

Also, maybe put a few words about each building that is on the page. 

Maybe have a link to a website for each building? 

====================
Entertainment Page
====================
Nice layout. Like the links to each site!

Use the same header as other pages, so no need to highlight Title with pink. Make
it look same as others.

The Navigation bar should be the same as other pages. Also some of the links are broken - About Albany and Live Entertainment (should be just Entertainment) and College links are broken. 

"Mvp" should be all caps: "MVP"

html file:
<title> should not be "document", but consistent with other pages: 
<title>Albany Entertainment</title>
.css file
h2 and h3 are exactly the same. Don't need both. 

=======================
Gardens Page
=====================
Very nice layout and good links to each garden site. 
Excellent Navigation bar. 

Maybe make the Albany Tulip Festival section like the other featured gardens?
At first, it looks like the page is going to be all about the Albany Tulip Festival 
because it's so big and I didn't see the "Gardens" heading at first.

Very nice picture and description of each garden.
